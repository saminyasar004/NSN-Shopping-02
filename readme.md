Hello,

Here I created an E-commerce Website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP.
idea: https://trycasuals.com/

How can you use this:

1. First install XAMPP Server on your pc. Here is the link of XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2. Then go to XAMPP folder which is situated on your C-Drive (By default) and click the xampp controle.exe. then start apache & mysql
3. Then open your favourite browser and type localhost/phpmyadmin (make surethe apache & mysqli is runnig successfully)
4. then go to the folder which I provided by this repository and find the Database folder. Inside of this folder you can see a sql file which is e-commerce.sql
5. Now return to the browser and click the new then go import then select the sql file (e-commerce.sql).
6. Now type localhost/E-commerce
7. let's enjoy...
